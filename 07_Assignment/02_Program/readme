2. Write a program which create three level process hierarchy where process 1 creates process 2 and it internally creates process 3.

outpute:
$ ./myexe
Child process1 is created by parent 
Parent of Process1 is running with PID:6110 
Process1 is running with PID:6111 
Child process2 is created by parent
Parent of Process2 is running with PID:6111 
Process2 is running with PID:6112 
Child process3 is created by parent 
Parent of Process3 is running with PID:6112 
Process3 is running with PID:6113 
Child Process3 gets terminated with PID: 6113
Process2 gets terminates with PID:6112
Child Process2 gets terminated
Process1 gets terminates with PID:6111
Child Process1 gets terminated
Main Process gets terminates with PID:6110
